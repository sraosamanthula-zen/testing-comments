! This Fortran program solves a system of linear equations using the Gauss-Seidel iterative method.
! It reads a matrix of coefficients and a vector of constants, then iteratively computes the solution vector.
! The business requirement fulfilled by this program is to provide a computational method for solving linear systems.

program x
  real a(10,10), b(10), x(10), y(10), t
  integer i, j, n

  ! Read the size of the matrix and vectors
  read(*,*) n

  ! Read the matrix of coefficients
  do i = 1, n
    do j = 1, n
      read(*,*) a(i,j)  ! Input each element of the matrix
    end do
  end do

  ! Read the vector of constants and initialize the solution vector
  do i = 1, n
    read(*,*) b(i)  ! Input each element of the constants vector
    x(i) = 0.0  ! Initialize the solution vector to zero
  end do

  ! Perform Gauss-Seidel iteration for a fixed number of iterations (100 iterations)
  do 1 i = 1, 100
    ! Copy the constants vector to a temporary vector
    do j = 1, n
      y(j) = b(j)  ! Initialize temporary vector with constants
    end do

    ! Update the temporary vector based on the current solution estimate
    do j = 1, n
      do i = 1, n
        if (i .ne. j) then
          y(j) = y(j) - a(j,i) * x(i)  ! Subtract the influence of other variables
        end if
      end do
    end do

    ! Update the solution vector using the temporary vector
    do j = 1, n
      x(j) = y(j) / a(j,j)  ! Divide by the diagonal element to solve for the variable
    end do
1   continue

  ! Output the solution vector
  do i = 1, n
    write(*,*) x(i)  ! Print each element of the solution vector
  end do

end

! Note: The program assumes that the input matrix is diagonally dominant for convergence.
! TODO: Consider adding a convergence check to terminate the iterations early if the solution stabilizes.
! This would involve checking if the changes in the solution vector between iterations fall below a certain threshold.
